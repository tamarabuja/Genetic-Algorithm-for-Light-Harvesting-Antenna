# A Genetic Algorithm to Evolve Light-Harvesting Antennas

The purpose of this algorithm was to design physically feasible photosynthetic ‘antenna’ structures on the surface of M-dwarf exoplanets by simulating the processes of natural selection and evolution. 
This involved optimising a general, kinetic model of light absorption and energy transfer to the photosystem reaction centre, written by Dr Chris Duffy. This was done by generating an amount of light-harvesting antenna structures with random peak absorbance wavelengths and numbers of pigments, ranking them by fitness (electron output and/or quantum efficiency) in a given environment, selecting a subset of the most fit structures to ‘reproduce’ by randomly combining with other fit structures to create hypothetically fitter daughter structures, and repeating this process until the population of antennas converges on a single structure that satisfies the energetic demands of that environment.



I first validated this model using a solar spectrum representing the light available on the surface of the Earth as the selection pressure, which resulted in antenna structures identical to chlorophyll a and b – known, evolutionarily successful antennas on Earth. I then applied the model to 1 and 10 m submarine environments, which resulted in cyanobacteria-like antenna structures, which again matched the result of real-life evolution. Having validated the model, I applied it to a synthetic stellar spectrum of an M-dwarf star at the distance of an orbiting earth-like exoplanet. This resulted in interesting, cyanobacteria-like structures which was promising evidence that not only are terrestrial photosynthetic antennas thermodynamically capable of harvesting light on these Earth-like exoplanets, but that they may even be evolutionarily optimised for it.
